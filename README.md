What is 10k?
--------------

10k is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. 10k uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. 10k is also the name of the open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the 10k client software, see http://www.mmxivcoin.com/snowball.html
